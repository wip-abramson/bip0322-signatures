## BIP-0322 Signatures for Verifiable Credentials

[BIP-0322: Generic Signed Message Format](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0322.mediawiki)

There are two jupyter notebooks in this folder. They attempt to demonstrate how you would use BIP-0322 signatures to sign and verify a VC. There is a notebook for each.

However, initially all these notebooks are trying to do is implement BIP-0322 signatures using the [buidl-python](https://github.com/buidl-bitcoin/buidl-python/) library developed by Jimmy Song. 

## Current Issues

I am currently unable to either verify or produce the signature provided in the BIP-0322 test vectors. However, using the current implementation in the signing notebook I am able to produce a signature, that can be verified in the verification notebook.

The most likely issue here is I have replicated the same error across both notebooks, however currently I have been unable to spot this.
